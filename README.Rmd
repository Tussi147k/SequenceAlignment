# SequenceAlignment

SequenceAlignment is an R package designed for performing DNA sequence alignment, analyzing results, and creating visualizations like heatmaps and bar plots. It is especially useful for bioinformatics workflows that involve comparing DNA sequences to reference datasets.

---

## Installation

To install the package from a local `.tar.gz` file:
```r
install.packages("SequenceAlignment_0.1.0.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")

library(SequenceAlignment)

input_seq <- "ATCGGGAA"
ref_seq <- "path to the FASTA file/s "
result <- perform_alignment(input_seq, ref_seq)

# View the alignment score
print(result$score)


file_paths <- c("file1.fasta", "file2.fasta")
ref_sequences <- load_reference_sequences(file_paths)

# View the loaded sequences
print(ref_sequences)


input_seq <- "ATCGTACG"
ref_files <- c("file1.fasta", "file2.fasta")
results <- analyze_input_sequence(input_seq, ref_files)

# View the results
print(results)

library(ggplot2)

# Simulated results for demonstration
results <- data.frame(
  Reference_Name = c("Ref1", "Ref2", "Ref3"),
  Alignment_Score = c(85, 92, 78)
)

# Generate the heatmap
heatmap_plot <- create_heatmap(results)
print(heatmap_plot)

output_file <- "alignment_results.csv"
save_results_to_csv(results, output_file)

# Verify the file was created
file.exists(output_file)
